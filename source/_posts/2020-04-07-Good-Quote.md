这篇文章主要记述了一些好的思想。

插一段最近看的小说里的一段话《怪物被杀就会死》

------

什么才是一个智慧生命真正成熟的时候？

　　对于普通远古部落时期的人类来说，度过生理期，肉体可以繁衍生育后代时，便能称之为成熟。

　　但毫无疑问，这个标准已经行不通了。刚刚度过青春期十几岁的孩子，怎么能称之为成熟？只有动物才会如此划分。

　　而对于近现代社会的人类来说，所谓的成熟，或许就是十八岁之后，接受了所有的基础教育，并可以承担刑事责任时，才能被称之为成熟。

　　但毫无疑问，这个标准同样也落伍了，十八岁说白了还是年轻人，这个年纪的人冲动又容易被煽动，激情四射但是却又难以把握自己的行动，他们肉体或许已经强健，但精神远未独立，更是有被称呼为‘巨婴’的个体，精神本质根本没有成长。

　　所以，对于普通的人类而言，最新的成熟标准，便已经变得非常高了。

　　他们要能洞察人与事物之间的联系，找到多元角度之间的交集，他们要有一个坚实的三观，并且还能不断地革新它，不断地扩展自己的视野。

　　所谓的成熟，就是知晓自己一言一行会造成何等后果，在对自己言行负责的同时，也知道自己的梦想是什么，并且有一套完整的计划为之奋斗努力，从不迷茫。

　　能看得出来，这样的标准，可以筛选掉很大一部分人。

　　也能看得出来，一代代人类文明不断进步，成熟的标准，也从单纯的肉体成长，变成了精神上的一种标准。







在大学期间，我的老师鼓励我们在课外时间多实践，于是我和我的队友经常参加一些比赛，

在比赛中，我作为队长，责任是给每个队友分配具体的任务，从整体上控制比赛的进度，还要和他们讨论并确定方案，甚至还要协调彼此的矛盾。我们之间互相帮助，互相信任，最后在比赛中取得了全国性的大奖，更重要的是我收获了如何领导别人的技巧。要有自信。只要你有自信，就不会有人怀疑你。人是喜欢猜想的动物，如果你表现得很淡定，很适应，别人就会以为你确实这样。所以当你有自信时，别人就会以为你真的了解自己在做什么。一个知道自己做什么的人会得到尊重、责任和信任。**态度要坚定，但也要仁慈。**因为你在领导着大家，你是订规矩、设界限的人。为此你必须坚定信念、坚持立场 。然而“独裁将会招致革命”。当坚持立场时要合情合理，也要理解下属的心情。最后，要鼓励下属。当你的团队出现困难的时候，作为领导者你应该鼓励下属，充分发挥他们的积极性，不能对他们抱怨和沮丧。团队的凝聚力是至关重要的。我认为在将来我会成为一个好的领导者，因为我一直把史蒂夫，乔布斯视作我的偶像，他创造了苹果公司，改变了很多人的生活方式。我梦想将来我也可以像他那样成为一个好的领导者，给世界带来一点改变。

in my opinion,my college education help me develop leadership qualities and skills.



During my college, my teacher encouraged us to practice more in spare time, so my teammates and I often participated in some competitions,



In the competitions, as the team captain, my responsibility is to assign specific tasks to each teammate, control the progress of the competitions , discuss and determine plans with them, and even coordinate conflicts with each other.



We helped each other, trusted each other, and finally won a national award in the competition. More importantly, I gained the skills of how to lead others.



firstly, you should Be confident. 
As long as you are confident, many people will not doubt you. 
People are animals who like to guess. If you behave calmly , others will think you are. 
So when you are confident, others will think you really understand what you are doing. 
A person who knows what he does will be respected, accountable and trusted.





secondly,your Attitude should be firm, but also be kind. 
Because you are leading everyone, you are the one who sets rules and sets boundaries. 
To this end, you must be firm in your beliefs.
When sticking to a stand, be reasonable and understand the mood of others.





 thirdly ,you should Be decisive. 
imaging  that You stand among a group of friends and discussing what to do. 
Everyone hesitated, complained to each other, and refused each other until someone stood up and said, "Okay, everyone, let's do this."
This person is standing at the top. When the team is hesitant, he can find out keenly and will stand up to lead everyone. 



Finally, u should encourage others. 
When your team is in trouble, as a leader, you should encourage  others  and not  frustrate them.  



I think I will be a good leader in the future, because I have always regarded Steve Jobs as my idol. He created Apple and changed the lifestyle of many people. 
I dream that I can become a good leader like him in the future and make a diffrenece to the world.

创新与传统之间的关系；解决问题的创新性的价值是什么？大品牌采取了什么创新性的方法来保持竞争力？

我认为创新是基于传统的，接下来我将讲述一个故事来证明它

I think innovation is based on tradition, and next I will tell a story to prove it

在2007年的时候，我13岁，正好在上初中，我记得大家用的手机都是一些杂牌子，它们大部分产自中国深圳，我非常喜欢玩他们的手机：然而大部分的手机功能单一：打电话，发短信，听MP3，稍微高级一点的手机会带照相机功能和录音功能；内置的几个游戏也都是俄罗斯方块和推箱子这种简单弱智类的游戏，突然有一天我发现一个有钱的亲戚用着一台苹果4：那神奇的触摸屏，那绚丽的色彩以及APP store上下载的游戏深深吸引了我，这是多么漂亮的一台手机啊，它简直堪称完美！

In 2007, when I was 13 years old, I was in  a junior high school. I remember that the mobile phones somebody use are all miscellaneous(米四类nins) brands. Most of them are produced in Shenzhen, China. I like to play with their mobile phones: However, most of the mobile phones have few function : call somebody, send messages, listen to music, some more advanced mobile phone will have camera function and recording function; several built-in games are also simple , such as Tetris and push box, and suddenly one day I found one Rich classmate used an iPhone4 : the magical touch screen, the brilliant colors and the games downloaded on the APP store deeply attracted me. What a beautiful mobile phone it is!

后来我一直对那台苹果4念念不忘，做梦都想拥有一台苹果4，但是我没有钱，于是我就去阅读关于乔布斯的传记，我发现乔布斯是一个追求完美的偏执狂：他对产品的严格要求造就了苹果，当时市面上流行的手机是很传统的诺基亚手机，它们大都是按键触控，单一色彩屏幕，而乔布斯创新性的采用了电容触摸屏，多点触控，不可拆卸电池、只有一颗Home键等新技术

Later, I always missed the iPhone4  and dreamed of owning an iPhone4 , but I didn’t have enough money, so I went to read the biography about Steve Jobs. I found that Steve Jobs was a paranoid who pursued perfection: his strict requirements for products made iPhone4 ,The popular mobile phones on the market at that time were traditional Nokia mobile phones. Most of them had touch buttons and single-color screens. Jobs innovatively used touch screens, multi-touch, and non-removable batteries. the Home button and other new technologies

iPhone4绝对是当时所有科技爱好者梦寐以求的一个产品，说iPhone4 引领了一个时代的消费电子产品趋势一点都不为过。iPhone4 是苹果在智能手机上的一次跨越，也是乔布斯发布的最后一款作品，在iPhone4s发布前夕，乔布斯去世了。


iPhone4 is Apple's leap on smartphones and the last work released by Jobs. but on the eve of the release of iPhone4s, Jobs passed away.



后来我读了大学，梦想着能拥有一台苹果手机，梦想着能像乔布斯那样做出伟大的电子产品。于是我选择了计算机专业，开始学习乔布斯的创新思路，虽然还有很长的路要走，慢慢来吧

Later I went to college, still dreaming of owning an iphone, and dreaming of making great electronic products like Jobs. 
So I chose a computer major and started to learn Jobs ’innovative ideas, although there is still a long way to go, take it easy

## city well-being

我居住在山东省日照市，据说这里是中国最早看到日出的地方，所以叫做日照。

I live in Rizhao City, Shandong Province 。It is said that this is the earliest place in China to see the sunrise, so it is called Rizhao.

这是一个很年轻的城市，虽然紧靠大海，但是发展的远没有邻居城市青岛那样好，

This is a very young city. Although it is close to the sea, it is far less developed than the neighboring city of Qingdao.

日照支柱产业是钢铁等传统重工业，这些重工业虽然能带来巨额的税收，但是却极大的破坏了日照的美好环境。

The pillar industries of Rizhao are traditional heavy industries such as steel. Although these heavy industries can bring huge taxes, they have greatly polluted the beautiful environment of Rizhao.

近些年来，市政府开始认识到要打造日照市的旅游特色，于是开始整治环境，关闭了一批高污染的企业，

In recent years, the city government began to realize the tourism characteristics of Rizhao City, so it began to renovate the environment and closed a batch of highly polluting enterprises

这导致了日照市的经济排名成为了山东省倒数第一，

This has led to Rizhao ’s economic ranking becoming the  lowest in Shandong Province,

近些年来政府开始大力发展互联网、旅游等产业，但是受限于地理位置和官场氛围，整个山东省的IT产业都不发达。我们的城市的互联网产业更是少的可怜。

In recent years, the government has begun to vigorously develop the Internet, tourism and other industries, but due to the geographical location and official atmosphere, the IT industry in Shandong Province is underdeveloped. 
The Internet industry in our city is even more pitiful.

作为一个日照市民，我很想毕业之后留在日照工作，但是有两个极大的问题挡住了我：一个是日照缺少计算机行业的公司，工资给的也很少，一个月也就几千元钱，另一个是日照的房价这几年竟然涨到了一万多一平米；周围人最羡慕的工作是政府的公务员，因为他们工作稳定且清闲。

As a citizen of Rizhao, I really want to stay in Rizhao after graduation, but there are two huge problems that block me: One is that Rizhao lacks a computer industry company, and the salary is also very small, which is several thousand yuan a month. 
 the other is that the house prices of Rizhao have risen to more than 10,000 square meters in recent years; the most enviable jobs for those around are government civil servants, because they work stably and freely.

我认为不止日照拥有这样的问题，其他北方城市都有这两个问题，想要解决这两个问题需要政府大力引导高新技术产业，教育民众多从事具有挑战性的高新技术行业，

I think that not only Rizhao has such problems, but other northern cities have these two problems. To solve these two problems, the government needs to vigorously guide high-tech industries and educate the public to engage in challenging high-tech industries.

## 观察渗透理论

**观察渗透理论**，是美国[科学哲学](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/科学哲学)家[汉森](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/汉森)提出的著名命题。这个命题指出了我们的任何观察都不是纯粹客观的，具有不同[知识](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/知识)背景的观察者观察同一事物，会得出不同的观察结果。“观察渗透理论”摧毁了[逻辑实证主义](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/逻辑实证主义)所追求的科学合理性。
